\title{On Design of Scalable P2P Video Caching}


\section{Related Work}

Video streaming caching is not a new idea, and it has been studied extensively in the recent years. Recognizing the particular properties of the multimedia streams, authors have proposed different caching strategies for the purposes of reducing the load on the network and multimedia server, and maximizing the delivered video quality.

For client/server architectures, proxy caches borrow from the concepts or Web caching. One example is the work of Sen et al. \cite{sen1999proxy}, where they assert that user experience is improved by storing the begging (or prefix) of the video and shielding the clients from a long delay when they start the playback. In a different approach, Rejaie et al. \cite{rejaie1999proxy,rejaie2000multimedia} propose a caching mechanism with a congestion control mechanism. They assume the video stream is divided into segments and encoded in several layers. When possible, the entire video is cached, and cache replacements are done per-layer basis, starting from the end of the layer with the lowest popularity.

In a similar approach, Wu et al. \cite{wu2001segment}, enhance the cache utilization efficiency by dividing the video object into segments of exponentially increasing sizes, effectively assigning a higher preference to beginning segments. Popularity is determined at the segment level, allowing a fined-grained control over segment replacement. The beginning segments are cached using a strictly least-recently used (LRU) policy, while for the rest the authors apply a modified LRU depending on segment size.

In \cite{reisslein2002interactive}, the authors developed a strategy that caches video objects based on the user request pattern. As opposed to calculate objects popularity based on past requests, their explicit tracking method uses the request history to estimate future requests, and cache the video objects accordingly. Ma and Du \cite{ma2002reducing} propose a segment-based caching method that stores alternating segments (chunks). In \cite{dan1997multimedia}, the authors present a generalized caching policy that maximizes the number of cached streams by storing short intervals of successive streams.

The increasing interest and research effort dedicated to peer-to-peer video streaming architectures, as opposed to the traditional client/server, has also generated many studies in the area of peer-to-peer caching. One example is PROP \cite{guo2004prop,chen2006design} where the authors examine the performance benefits offered by peer-to-peer caching complementing a classic segmentation-based proxy design. They show that video segment popularity is not a good metric for caching decision, and propose a new utility function that maximizes the caching probability for segments with mid-range popularity.

O. Saleh and M. Hefeeda \cite{saleh2006modeling} propose a generalized caching method for peer-to-peer content having a Mandelbrot-Zipf popularity. Exploring the impact of this popularity model on the cache efficiency, they conclude that objects must be cached incrementally proportional to their popularity. However, their study is focused on caching of atomic object, such shared files, rather than continuous streams.
